Password guessing game with hint

Project Overview:-

This is a simple and fun Python-based password guessing game where the user is prompted to guess a secret password. To make the game engaging and interactive, hints are provided after incorrect attempts. The goal is to help users practice logical thinking, string comparisons, and basic control flow in Python.
This beginner-friendly project is ideal for those learning Python and looking to understand how loops, conditionals, and user input work together in a game-based format.


Key Features:-

User-friendly command-line interface

Secret password stored securely in code

Hint system to assist the user after each wrong guess

Unlimited attempts or limited attempts (configurable)

Case-insensitive comparison

Victory message on correct guess

Optional feature to exit anytime

How It Works:-

The game starts by asking the user to guess a predefined secret password.
If the guess is incorrect, a hint is displayed to guide the user (e.g., first letter, length, category).
The loop continues until the correct password is guessed or the user chooses to quit (if enabled).
On success, a congratulatory message is shown.
